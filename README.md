# Cultivation furniture v0.0.1

This repo documents my first attempt at designing and building a prototype for modular furniture in which you can store water (required for life) and grow things (plants, mushrooms, microorganisms, materials) in an urban home. It fits into a broader project together with the Flowing Futures collective (see repo [add link here]).

## the idea

Our agriculturtal and industrial production systems play an important role in the continued destruction of and extraction from our environments. Our dependence on it also plays a role in our reliance on work to secure our subsitence. This is especially stark in urban environments, and (among those who have a permanent home) especially for people who live in apartments. 

Cultivation furniture is a practical exploration (about how can we grow some of the things we need and want in our own homes) as well as way to invite people to reimagine the function and experience of domestic spaces. 

To begin making this idea a reality, I tried to find a minimum viable furniture.

I landed on a small coffee table or bedside table as an initial
