# Cultivation furniture v0.0.1

![image: the final prototype](wideShotFINAL.JPEG)

This repo documents my first attempt at designing and building a prototype for modular furniture in which you can store water (required for life) and grow things (plants, mushrooms, microorganisms, materials) in an urban home. It fits into a broader project together with the Flowing Futures collective (see repo [add link here]).

## the idea

Our agriculturtal and industrial production systems play an important role in the continued destruction of and extraction from our environments. Our dependence on it also plays a role in our reliance on work to secure our subsitence. This is especially stark in urban environments, and (among those who have a permanent home) especially for people who live in apartments. 

Cultivation furniture is a practical exploration (about how can we grow some of the things we need and want in our own homes) as well as way to invite people to reimagine the function and experience of domestic spaces. 

To begin making this idea a reality, I tried to find a minimum viable furniture.


## the process (what i did)

I landed on a small coffee table or bedside table as an initial furniture. The idea was to make it as modular as possible. That is why I opted for a triangle as a top / bottom shape (due to the ease of making various shape out of many triangles). The size of the triangle was chosen based on the size of wine bottles when arranged in either a very compact setup (which is not the one I opted for for the first iteration), or a more airy, simple setu, where wine bottles are only present in the center of the triangle and on the connecting sides. 

The cultivation I opted for in this first iteration is wick hydroponics. This is commonly described as the most simple hydroponics setup. It involves a substrate at the top (in this case, in the upper wine bottle, the base of which was cut off), and a nutriment solution at the bottom (the lower wine bottle, int this case). The two containers are connected via a wick (e.g an old textiele, or some string). The nutriment solution travels up to the plant's roots in the substrate via capillary action (for an explanation, see, for example: https://www.trees.com/gardening-and-landscaping/hydroponic-wick-systems).inital 

After initial drawings and musings I visualised my initial ideas in 3D by building an extremely rough prototype:

Much still had to be determined, e.g. the way the two trianglee boards should be connected.

After much thinking about how bottles could be arranged (and thus, how large the triangles should be)....

... I opted for a model where a central bottle could be surrounded by three more, and then connected to other triangles by another three. After prototyping in thin wood with a lasercutter and seeing what it looked like on 0.25L bottles, I cut it in plywood using Fablab Barcelona's CNC because that's what was available where I was. You could use any number of other materials, variations omn shape and size.

Somewhere in-between thinking about the triangles, I was also exploring various ways of connecting the wine bottles.

For example, I got enthralled with the aesthetic qualities of copper and latex tubing, so tried to build a contraption out of 18mmm copper connecctors and latex tubes. Unfortunately, this didn't work because the copper connectors didn't fit into the bottle.

While it didn't work out in the end, it did allow me to see if the modular setup made sense (I tought it did). Some tape was also requiree (as always..).

Since the copper version didn't work, I set out to find a different solution. I had a 3D printer at home, so I went for a solution involving that. 

To better understand what would work as well as the size of my wine bottle including differences in the flexibility of my PLA filament and to test my (new) 3D printer etc, I decided to print out an oil dispenser add-on for wine bottles (that I found on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4727790).

in this image you can also see an idea that emerged in that moment, which is to use ordinary elastic bands (that you might use 

I used two different models that I found on thingiverse: 1) and 2). I then scaled those to the size of a wine bottle.
