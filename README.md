# Cultivation furniture v0.0.1

This repo documents my first attempt at designing and building a prototype for modular furniture in which you can store water (required for life) and grow things (plants, mushrooms, microorganisms, materials) in an urban home. It fits into a broader project together with the Flowing Futures collective (see repo [add link here]).

## the idea

Our agriculturtal and industrial production systems play an important role in the continued destruction of and extraction from our environments. Our dependence on it also plays a role in our reliance on work to secure our subsitence. This is especially stark in urban environments, and (among those who have a permanent home) especially for people who live in apartments. 

Cultivation furniture is a practical exploration (about how can we grow some of the things we need and want in our own homes) as well as way to invite people to reimagine the function and experience of domestic spaces. 

To begin making this idea a reality, I tried to find a minimum viable furniture.


## the process (what i did)

I landed on a small coffee table or bedside table as an initial furniture. The idea was to make it as modular as possible. That is why I opted for a triangle as a top / bottom shape (due to the ease of making various shape out of many triangles). The size of the triangle was chosen based on the size of wine bottles when arranged in either a very compact setup (which is not the one I opted for for the first iteration), or a more airy, simple setu, where wine bottles are only present in the center of the triangle and on the connecting sides. 

The cultivation I opted for in this first iteration is wick hydroponics. This is commonly described as the most simple hydroponics setup. It involves a substrate at the top (in this case, in the upper wine bottle, the base of which was cut off), and a nutriment solution at the bottom (the lower wine bottle, int this case). The two containers are connected via a wick (e.g an old textiele, or some string). The nutriment solution travels up to the plant's roots in the substrate via capillary action (see: https://www.trees.com/gardening-and-landscaping/hydroponic-wick-systems).
